**Birthday Planner**

BirthdayPlanner is a Java application that generates a birthday activity plan based on a user-provided input string. 
The plan is generated using a combination of main activities, cafes, and restaurants, ensuring that activities follow specific rules.

This was submitted as a coursework for my first year at rhul in the OOP II module.
